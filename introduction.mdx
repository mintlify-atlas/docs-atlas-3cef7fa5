## Key Features

### Intelligent Agents

OpenCode includes specialized agents for different tasks:

- **Build Agent** - Full development with all tools enabled
- **Plan Agent** - Analysis and planning without making changes
- **General Subagent** - Complex research and parallel tasks
- **Explore Subagent** - Fast, read-only codebase exploration

Switch between agents with the **Tab** key or invoke them via `@` mentions.

## Workflow Patterns

### Plan, Review, Build

<Steps>
  <Step title="Switch to Plan Mode">
    Press **Tab** to enter Plan mode. Describe your feature or change.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review the Plan">
    OpenCode creates a detailed implementation plan without touching code.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Build It">
    Press **Tab** again to switch to Build mode. Say "go ahead" to implement.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Ask Questions

Use the `@` key to fuzzy search and reference files:

```txt
How is authentication handled in @src/auth/index.ts
```

### Add Features

Provide context and examples for best results:

```txt
Add a delete confirmation modal. Use the same pattern as @src/modals/ConfirmModal.tsx
but customize the message and button styles.
```

### Make Changes

Direct requests work great for straightforward modifications:

```txt
Update the API endpoint in @config/api.ts to use the production URL
```
