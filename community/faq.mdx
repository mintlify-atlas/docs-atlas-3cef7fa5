Common questions about OpenCode, installation, usage, and troubleshooting.

## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is OpenCode?" icon="circle-question">
    OpenCode is an AI coding agent CLI tool that helps developers with software engineering tasks. It's a powerful command-line interface that uses large language models to assist with coding, debugging, refactoring, and more.

    OpenCode can:
    - Write and edit code across multiple files
    - Debug and fix issues
    - Refactor and optimize code
    - Generate documentation
    - Answer questions about your codebase
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is OpenCode different from other AI coding tools?" icon="code-compare">
    OpenCode is designed as a CLI-first tool that gives you full control over your development workflow. Unlike IDE-specific tools, OpenCode:

    - Works in any terminal environment
    - Supports multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more)
    - Offers a plugin system for extensibility
    - Provides both TUI (Terminal UI) and web interfaces
    - Has an active open-source community building plugins and integrations
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is OpenCode free?" icon="dollar-sign">
    OpenCode itself is free and open-source software licensed under the MIT license. However, you'll need API access to AI providers (like OpenAI or Anthropic) which have their own pricing.

    Some community plugins provide alternative authentication methods that can reduce or eliminate API costs by using existing subscriptions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What AI providers does OpenCode support?" icon="server">
    OpenCode supports multiple AI providers including:

    - OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5)
    - Anthropic (Claude)
    - Google (Gemini)
    - And many more through community plugins

    To add support for a new provider, contribute to [models.dev](https://github.com/anomalyco/models.dev).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Installation & Setup

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I install OpenCode?" icon="download">
    The easiest way to install OpenCode is via npm:

    ```bash
    npm install -g opencode
    ```

    Or using your preferred package manager:

    ```bash
    # Using Yarn
    yarn global add opencode

    # Using pnpm
    pnpm add -g opencode
    ```

    For development, see the [Contributing guide](/community/contributing) for instructions on building from source.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I configure my API keys?" icon="key">
    OpenCode will prompt you to configure your API keys when you first run it. You can also manually configure them:

    ```bash
    opencode config
    ```

    Your configuration is stored securely in your home directory.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the system requirements?" icon="computer">
    OpenCode requires:

    - Node.js 18 or higher (for npm installation)
    - Bun 1.3+ (for development)
    - A terminal emulator with modern features
    - API access to at least one supported AI provider

    OpenCode runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Usage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I start using OpenCode?" icon="play">
    Navigate to your project directory and run:

    ```bash
    opencode
    ```

    This will start the TUI (Terminal User Interface) where you can interact with the AI agent. You can also use specific commands:

    ```bash
    # Start web interface
    opencode web

    # Start headless server
    opencode serve

    # Run in a specific directory
    opencode /path/to/project
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What commands does OpenCode support?" icon="terminal">
    OpenCode supports various commands:

    - `opencode` - Start TUI in current directory
    - `opencode web` - Start web interface
    - `opencode serve` - Start headless API server
    - `opencode attach <url>` - Attach to existing server
    - `opencode --help` - Show all available commands

    Within the TUI, you can use slash commands like `/help`, `/clear`, `/exit`, and more.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use OpenCode with my IDE?" icon="code">
    Yes! OpenCode is designed to work alongside your IDE. Some community projects provide deeper integration:

    - [opencode.nvim](https://github.com/NickvanDyke/opencode.nvim) - Neovim plugin
    - [OpenChamber](https://github.com/btriapitsyn/openchamber) - VS Code Extension
    - [OpenCode-Obsidian](https://github.com/mtymek/opencode-obsidian) - Obsidian plugin

    Check out the [Ecosystem](/community/ecosystem) page for more integrations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I install plugins?" icon="puzzle-piece">
    OpenCode has a plugin system that allows you to extend functionality. To install plugins, you typically:

    1. Install the plugin package via npm
    2. Configure it in your OpenCode settings

    Some plugins may have additional setup steps. Check the plugin's documentation for specific instructions.

    See the [Ecosystem](/community/ecosystem) page for available plugins.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OpenCode is not responding or hanging" icon="spinner">
    If OpenCode appears to hang:

    1. Check if the AI provider's API is responsive
    2. Verify your API key is valid and has sufficient credits
    3. Try restarting OpenCode
    4. Check for any error messages in the terminal

    If you're using shell commands that require interactive input, consider using the [opencode-shell-strategy](https://github.com/JRedeker/opencode-shell-strategy) plugin to prevent TTY-related hangs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm getting API rate limit errors" icon="ban">
    Rate limit errors mean you're making too many requests to the AI provider's API. To resolve:

    1. Wait for the rate limit to reset (usually a few minutes)
    2. Consider upgrading your API plan for higher limits
    3. Use the [opencode-dynamic-context-pruning](https://github.com/Tarquinen/opencode-dynamic-context-pruning) plugin to optimize token usage
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The AI is not understanding my codebase" icon="question">
    To help the AI better understand your codebase:

    1. Provide clear, specific instructions
    2. Reference specific files or functions
    3. Use the [opencode-type-inject](https://github.com/nick-vi/opencode-type-inject) plugin for better type awareness
    4. Break down complex tasks into smaller steps
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I report a bug?" icon="bug">
    To report a bug:

    1. Check if the issue already exists in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/issues)
    2. Use the Bug Report template when creating a new issue
    3. Include:
       - OpenCode version (`opencode --version`)
       - Your operating system
       - Steps to reproduce
       - Expected vs. actual behavior
       - Any error messages
