OpenCode's session sharing feature creates public links to your AI conversations, enabling collaboration, code reviews, debugging assistance, and knowledge sharing.

<Note>
Shared sessions are **publicly accessible** to anyone with the link. Review content before sharing to avoid exposing sensitive information.
</Note>

## How Session Sharing Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create or select a session">
    Work on your code in a session as usual. The session contains:
    - Full conversation history (your prompts + AI responses)
    - File diffs and code changes
    - Tool use records (file reads, writes, bash commands)
    - Session metadata (title, creation date, model used)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Share the session">
    Run `/share` command or use the API:
    
    ```bash
    # In TUI
    /share
    
    # Via API
    curl -X POST http://localhost:4096/session/<session-id>/share
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Unique URL generated">
    OpenCode creates a unique share URL:
    
    ```
    https://opncd.ai/s/s_abc123xyz789
    ```
    
    The URL is automatically copied to your clipboard (TUI) or returned in the API response.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Data synced to cloud">
    Session data is uploaded to OpenCode's servers:
    - All messages and responses
    - File diffs (not full file contents)
    - Session configuration
    - Metadata (timestamps, model info)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Share the link">
    Send the URL to teammates via:
    - Slack/Teams/Discord
    - Email
    - GitHub PR comments
    - Documentation
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Sharing Modes

OpenCode supports three sharing modes to match different workflows and security requirements.

### Manual (Default)

Sessions are **not** shared automatically. You explicitly control when to share.

```bash
# Share current session
/share

# Unshare when done
/unshare
```

**Configuration** (optional):

```json opencode.json
{
  "$schema": "https://opncd.ai/config.json",
  "share": "manual"
}
```

<Accordion title="When to use Manual mode">
  - Default safe mode for most users
  - Working with proprietary code
  - Only sharing specific debugging sessions
  - Explicit control over what gets shared
</Accordion>

### Auto-share

Every new session is **automatically** shared upon creation.

```json opencode.json
{
  "$schema": "https://opncd.ai/config.json",
  "share": "auto"
}
```

<Accordion title="When to use Auto-share mode">
  - Open source projects
  - Team collaboration where all sessions should be visible
  - Educational/tutorial content creation
  - Public coding demonstrations
  
  <Warning>
  Review session content regularly. Even with auto-share, you can `/unshare` individual sessions.
  </Warning>
</Accordion>

### Disabled

Sharing is completely **disabled**. The `/share` command will not work.

```json opencode.json
{
  "$schema": "https://opncd.ai/config.json",
  "share": "disabled"
}
```

<Accordion title="When to use Disabled mode">
  - Enterprise environments with strict data policies
  - Highly sensitive projects (healthcare, finance, defense)
  - Compliance requirements (HIPAA, SOC 2, ISO 27001)
  - Air-gapped or offline development
  
  <Note>
  For team-wide enforcement, commit `opencode.json` with `"share": "disabled"` to version control.
  </Note>
</Accordion>

## Using the Share API

### Share a Session

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST http://localhost:4096/session/abc123/share
```

```json Response
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "title": "Add authentication",
  "shareID": "s_xyz789abc",
  "shareURL": "https://opncd.ai/s/s_xyz789abc",
  "createdAt": 1708387200000,
  "updatedAt": 1708387200000,
  "parentID": null
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<ResponseField name="shareID" type="string">
  Unique identifier for the shared session (prefixed with `s_`).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="shareURL" type="string">
  Full public URL to the shared session.
</ResponseField>

### Unshare a Session

Remove public access and delete cloud data:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:4096/session/abc123/share
```

```json Response
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "title": "Add authentication",
  "shareID": null,
  "shareURL": null,
  "createdAt": 1708387200000,
  "updatedAt": 1708387260000,
  "parentID": null
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
`shareID` and `shareURL` become `null` after unsharing. The link will return 404.
</Note>

### Check Share Status

Query whether a session is currently shared:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl http://localhost:4096/session/abc123
```

```json Shared Session
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "shareID": "s_xyz789abc",
  "shareURL": "https://opncd.ai/s/s_xyz789abc",
  ...
}
```

```json Not Shared
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "shareID": null,
  "shareURL": null,
  ...
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## What Gets Shared

When you share a session, the following data is uploaded:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Conversation History" icon="comments">
    - All user prompts (your messages)
    - All AI responses (assistant messages)
    - Tool use records (file operations, bash commands)
    - Timestamps and message order
    - Model and provider information
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="File Diffs" icon="code-compare">
    - Diffs of changed files (hunks with context)
    - File paths relative to project root
    - **Not full file contents**, only changes made during the session
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Session Metadata" icon="info-circle">
    - Session title
    - Creation and update timestamps
    - Parent session ID (if forked)
    - Agent used (e.g., `task`, `research`)
    - Model configuration
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Todo Lists" icon="list-check">
    - Task breakdown and planning
    - Task completion status
    - Task descriptions
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### What is NOT Shared

<Warning>
**Data that remains local:**
- Full source code files (only diffs are shared)
- Environment variables
- API keys and secrets (never include these in prompts!)
- Local file paths outside the project
- Git history or repository metadata
- User's global OpenCode configuration
</Warning>

## Privacy and Security

### Data Retention

Shared sessions remain accessible **indefinitely** until explicitly unshared.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial share">
    Data uploaded to `opncd.ai` servers.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Link active">
    Anyone with the URL can view the session.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Unshare">
    Run `/unshare` to delete the share:
    - Link becomes invalid (404)
    - Data removed from servers within 24 hours
    - Local session remains intact
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Automatic expiration is not currently supported. Always manually unshare sessions when collaboration is complete.
</Note>

### Access Control

Shared sessions use **URL-based access** (no authentication required):

- ✅ Simple sharing (no account needed)
- ✅ Works with any browser
- ❌ Anyone with the link can access
- ❌ Cannot restrict to specific users

<Accordion title="Securing Shared Sessions">
  **Best Practices:**
  
  1. **Treat share URLs like passwords**
     - Share via secure channels (encrypted chat, private repos)
     - Avoid posting in public forums or social media
  
  2. **Time-box sharing**
     - Unshare immediately after collaboration ends
     - Review active shares periodically
  
  3. **Use short-lived channels**
     - Send links via disappearing messages (Signal, Telegram)
     - Share in private GitHub comments, not PR descriptions
  
  4. **Monitor access** (future feature)
     - Request: Star [#issue-number] for access logs
</Accordion>

### Compliance Considerations

For regulated industries (healthcare, finance, government):

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="HIPAA" icon="hospital">
    **Do not share sessions** containing PHI (Protected Health Information). Use `"share": "disabled"` for HIPAA-regulated projects.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="GDPR" icon="scale-balanced">
    Shared sessions may contain personal data. Ensure compliance with:
    - Data processing agreements
    - User consent requirements
    - Right to erasure (use `/unshare`)
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="SOC 2" icon="shield-halved">
    Sharing may violate data residency or access control policies. Audit `"share": "auto"` configurations.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Export Control" icon="ban">
    Government/defense contractors: Verify that sharing complies with ITAR, EAR, or similar regulations.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Recommendations by Project Type

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Open Source">
    ✅ **Auto-share enabled**
    
    ```json opencode.json
    {
      "share": "auto"
    }
    ```
    
    Benefits:
    - Community can learn from your process
    - Easy debugging help from maintainers
    - Transparent development
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Private Startup">
    ⚠️ **Manual sharing (default)**
    
    ```json opencode.json
    {
      "share": "manual"
    }
    ```
    
    Guidelines:
    - Only share for code reviews or pair programming
    - Unshare after resolving the issue
    - Avoid sharing sessions with business logic
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Enterprise">
    🛑 **Sharing disabled**
    
    ```json opencode.json

</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="/share command does nothing">
    **Possible causes:**
    
    1. Sharing is disabled in config:
       ```bash
       # Check config
       cat ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json | grep share
       # Should not be "disabled"
       ```
    
    2. Network connectivity issues:
       ```bash
       # Test connectivity
       curl https://opncd.ai/health
       ```
    
    3. Session has no content yet:
       - Only sessions with messages can be shared
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Share URL returns 404">
    **Reasons:**
    
    - Session was unshared
    - Share ID is incorrect (typo in URL)
    - Server maintenance (rare, check status page)
    
    **Fix:** Re-share the session to generate a new URL.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Cannot unshare session">
    **Workarounds:**
    
    1. Try via API:
       ```bash
       curl -X DELETE http://localhost:4096/session/<id>/share
       ```
    
    2. Contact support if data must be removed urgently:
       [support@opencode.ai](mailto:support@opencode.ai)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Accidentally shared sensitive data">
    **Immediate steps:**
    
    1. Unshare the session immediately:
       ```bash
       /unshare
       ```
    
    2. Delete the session locally:
       ```bash
       # In TUI: Open sessions (Ctrl+P → Sessions) → Delete
       ```
    
    3. If secrets were exposed:
       - Rotate API keys immediately
       - Revoke OAuth tokens
       - Change passwords
    
    4. Contact support for expedited deletion:
       [security@opencode.ai](mailto:security@opencode.ai)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review before sharing">
    Skim the session for sensitive data:
    
    - API keys or tokens
    - Internal URLs or hostnames
    - Customer data or PII
    - Proprietary algorithms
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use descriptive titles">
    ```bash
    # Good titles
    "Fix authentication bug in /api/login"
    "Refactor database migrations"
    
    # Bad titles
    "Debug"
    "Session 1"
    ```
    
    Recipients understand context immediately.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Share early in collaboration">
    Share at the start of debugging/pairing sessions, not after. Collaborators see your thought process in real-time.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Unshare when done">
    Add a reminder:
    
    ```bash
    # ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
    alias opencode='echo "Remember to /unshare when done!" && command opencode'
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Document in PRs">
    Include share links in pull request descriptions:
    
    ```markdown
    ## Changes
    - Added user authentication
    
    ## Context
    See development session: https://opncd.ai/s/s_abc123
    ```
