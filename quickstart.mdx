Get OpenCode running on your first project in under 5 minutes.

## Install OpenCode

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install via script">
    The fastest way to install OpenCode:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
    ```

    Or use your preferred package manager:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash npm
    npm install -g opencode-ai
    ```
    ```bash brew
    brew install anomalyco/tap/opencode
    ```
    ```bash chocolatey
    choco install opencode
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify installation">
    Check that OpenCode is installed:

    ```bash
    opencode --version
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
For Windows users, we recommend using [WSL](/windows-wsl) for the best experience.
</Tip>

## Configure a Provider

OpenCode works with any LLM provider. We recommend starting with OpenCode Zen for a curated experience.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start OpenCode">
    Navigate to any directory and launch OpenCode:

    ```bash
    cd ~/my-project
    opencode
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect to a provider">
    In the OpenCode interface, run:

    ```
    /connect
    ```

    Select **opencode** (Zen) from the provider list.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get your API key">
    Visit [opencode.ai/auth](https://opencode.ai/auth), sign in, and copy your API key.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Paste the API key">
    Return to OpenCode and paste your API key when prompted.

    ```
    ┌ API key
    │ [paste your key]
    └ enter
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
You can also configure other providers like Anthropic, OpenAI, or local models. See [Providers](/providers) for more options.
</Note>

## Initialize Your Project

Help OpenCode understand your codebase by initializing it:

```
/init
```

This command:
- Analyzes your project structure
- Identifies coding patterns
- Creates an `AGENTS.md` file with project context

<Tip>
Commit the generated `AGENTS.md` file to version control so your team benefits from the same context.
</Tip>

---

## Start Coding

You're ready! Here are some things you can try:

### Ask Questions

Ask OpenCode about your codebase:

```
How does authentication work in this project?
```

Use `@` to reference specific files:

```
Explain the logic in @src/auth/login.ts
```

### Make Changes

Request code modifications:

```
Add error handling to the login function
```

Switch to **Plan mode** (press `Tab`) to review changes before applying them.

### Run Commands

Execute bash commands with `!`:

```
!npm test
```

Or use slash commands:

```
/undo    # Revert the last change
/redo    # Reapply a reverted change
/share   # Share the current conversation
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Tab` | Switch between Build and Plan agents |
| `@` | Reference a file |
| `!` | Run a bash command |
| `/` | Execute a slash command |
| `Ctrl+C` | Cancel current operation |

See [Keybinds](/keybinds) for the complete list.
