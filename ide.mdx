---

OpenCode integrates with VS Code, Cursor, or any IDE that supports a terminal. Just run `opencode` in the terminal to get started.

## Features

- **Quick Launch**: Use keyboard shortcuts to open OpenCode instantly in a split terminal view
- **New Session**: Start multiple OpenCode sessions with dedicated shortcuts
- **Context Awareness**: Automatically share your current selection or tab with OpenCode
- **File Reference Shortcuts**: Quickly insert file references into OpenCode prompts

## Usage

### Keyboard Shortcuts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Quick Launch">
    Use `Cmd+Esc` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Esc` (Windows/Linux) to open OpenCode in a split terminal view, or focus an existing terminal session if one is already running.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="New Session">
    Use `Cmd+Shift+Esc` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+Esc` (Windows/Linux) to start a new OpenCode terminal session, even if one is already open. You can also click the OpenCode button in the UI.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="File Reference Shortcuts">
    Use `Cmd+Option+K` (Mac) or `Alt+Ctrl+K` (Linux/Windows) to insert file references. For example, `@File#L37-42`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Context Awareness

OpenCode automatically shares your current selection or active tab with the AI, providing relevant context for your requests without manual copying and pasting.

## Installation

To install OpenCode on VS Code and popular forks like Cursor, Windsurf, VSCodium:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open VS Code">
    Launch your IDE (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, or VSCodium).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open the integrated terminal">
    Open the integrated terminal in your IDE.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run opencode">
    Run `opencode` - the extension installs automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

If on the other hand you want to use your own IDE when you run `/editor` or `/export` from the TUI, you'll need to set `export EDITOR="code --wait"`. [Learn more](/tui#editor-setup).

### Manual Install

Search for **OpenCode** in the Extension Marketplace and click **Install**.

### Supported IDEs

OpenCode supports the following IDEs:

- **VS Code** - The standard Visual Studio Code editor
- **Cursor** - AI-first code editor built on VS Code
- **Windsurf** - Collaborative code editor
- **VSCodium** - Open-source builds of VS Code without Microsoft branding/telemetry

All VS Code-compatible IDEs that support extensions should work with OpenCode.

## Troubleshooting

If the extension fails to install automatically:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check terminal">
    Ensure you're running `opencode` in the integrated terminal, not an external terminal.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify CLI installation">
    Confirm the CLI for your IDE is installed:
    - For VS Code: `code` command
    - For Cursor: `cursor` command
    - For Windsurf: `windsurf` command
    - For VSCodium: `codium` command
    
    If not, run `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) and search for "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH" (or the equivalent for your IDE).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check permissions">
    Ensure VS Code has permission to install extensions. Some organizations restrict extension installation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Editor Setup for TUI

If you want to use a specific editor when running `/editor` or `/export` from the OpenCode TUI, set the `EDITOR` environment variable:

```bash
export EDITOR="code --wait"
```

For other editors:

```bash
# For Cursor
export EDITOR="cursor --wait"

# For Vim
export EDITOR="vim"

# For Nano
export EDITOR="nano"

# For Sublime Text
export EDITOR="subl --wait"
```

The `--wait` flag tells the editor to wait until the file is closed before returning control to OpenCode.
