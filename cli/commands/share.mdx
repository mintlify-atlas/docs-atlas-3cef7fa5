title: "/share - Share Sessions"
description: "Create shareable links to your OpenCode conversations"
---

## Overview

The `/share` command creates a public URL for your OpenCode session that others can view. This allows you to:

- Share conversations with teammates
- Get help by showing your session
- Document problem-solving workflows
- Create tutorials and examples
- Collaborate on code reviews

## Usage

```
/share
```

The command generates a shareable URL:

```
https://opncd.ai/s/abc123def456
```

## What Gets Shared

Shared sessions include:

- **Full conversation** - All messages and responses
- **Tool executions** - Commands run and outputs
- **File contexts** - Code and files referenced
- **Metadata** - Model, agent, timestamps

<Warning>
  Shared sessions are **public**. Anyone with the link can view the content. Don't share sensitive information.
</Warning>

## Viewing Shared Sessions

Recipients can:

1. **Open in browser** - View the conversation
2. **Copy messages** - Extract code or content
3. **See tool outputs** - Understand what was executed
4. **Import session** - Load into their OpenCode

### Import a Shared Session

Anyone can import a shared session:

```bash
opencode import https://opncd.ai/s/abc123def456
```

This creates a local copy they can continue working with.

## Automatic Sharing

Enable automatic sharing for all sessions:

### Via Environment Variable

```bash
export OPENCODE_AUTO_SHARE=true
opencode
```

### Via Configuration

In `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "share": "auto"
}
```

### Via CLI Flag

With the `run` command:

```bash
opencode run --share "Fix the bug in app.ts"
```

With auto-share enabled, every session is shared automatically and the URL is displayed:

```
~ https://opncd.ai/s/abc123def456
```

## Disabling Sharing

To prevent sharing in your organization or workspace:

### Via Configuration

```json
{
  "share": "disabled"
}
```

With sharing disabled:

```
User: /share
Assistant: ! Sharing is disabled in this workspace
```

### Per-Session Control

Sharing can be controlled per session:

```json
{
  "share": "manual"  // Default, requires /share command
}
```

Options:
- `"auto"` - Share all sessions automatically
- `"manual"` - Share only when `/share` is used (default)
- `"disabled"` - Prevent all sharing

## Privacy Considerations

<Warning>
  Shared sessions are **publicly accessible**. Review content before sharing.
</Warning>

### What NOT to Share

Avoid sharing sessions containing:

- API keys or credentials
- Private code or intellectual property
- Personal information (PII)
- Internal URLs or infrastructure details
- Confidential business logic
- Security vulnerabilities (before they're fixed)

### Redacting Sensitive Data

Before sharing:

1. Review the full conversation
2. Undo messages with sensitive content
3. Fork the session and remove sensitive parts
4. Use environment variables instead of hardcoded secrets

### Revoking Shared Sessions

Currently, shared sessions cannot be deleted after creation. Be cautious about what you share.

<Note>
  Future versions may support revoking or editing shared sessions.
</Note>

## Use Cases

### Getting Help

Share your session when asking for help:

```
User: /share
User: [copies link]

# In Slack/Discord:
"I'm stuck on this error. Here's my OpenCode session: https://opncd.ai/s/..."
```

### Code Review

Share a session showing your problem-solving process:

```
User: /share
User: "Created PR #123. Here's how we solved it: https://opncd.ai/s/..."
```

### Documentation

Create tutorials by sharing instructional sessions:

```
User: /share
User: "Tutorial on setting up authentication: https://opncd.ai/s/..."
```

### Bug Reports

Include session links in bug reports:

```markdown
## Bug Report

**Description**: API endpoint returns 500 error

**Session**: https://opncd.ai/s/abc123def456

OpenCode helped me identify the issue is in the middleware...
```

### Team Collaboration

Share sessions for pair programming:

```
User: /share

# Team member imports and continues:
opencode import https://opncd.ai/s/abc123def456
```

## Programmatic Sharing

Share sessions via the API:

```typescript
import { createOpencodeClient } from '@opencode-ai/sdk/v2'

const client = createOpencodeClient({
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:4096'
})

const result = await client.session.share({
  sessionID: 'session-id'
})

console.log(result.data.share.url)
// https://opncd.ai/s/abc123def456
```

## Share URL Format

Share URLs follow this pattern:

```
https://opncd.ai/s/<slug>
              │   │
              │   └─ Unique session identifier
              └───── Share path
```

The slug is:
- Unique per session
- URL-safe (alphanumeric + hyphens)
- Permanent (doesn't expire)

## Import Command

Import shared sessions locally:

```bash
# From URL
opencode import https://opncd.ai/s/abc123def456

# Or just the slug
opencode import abc123def456
```

This:
1. Downloads the session data
2. Creates a local session
3. Preserves all messages and context
4. Allows you to continue the conversation

### Import Options

You can also import from files:

```bash
# From local JSON file
opencode import session.json

# From another session export
opencode export <session-id> > backup.json
opencode import backup.json
```

## Export vs Share

| Feature | /share | export |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Creates public URL | ✓ | ✗ |
| Exports to file | ✗ | ✓ |
| Requires internet | ✓ | ✗ |
| Public access | ✓ | ✗ |
| Local backup | ✗ | ✓ |

Use `/share` for collaboration, `export` for backups.

## Troubleshooting

### Sharing Failed

**Problem**: Cannot create share link

**Solutions**:
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify sharing isn't disabled in config
- Ensure OpenCode can reach `opncd.ai`
- Check firewall/proxy settings

### Sharing Disabled

**Problem**: `Sharing is disabled` error

**Solutions**:
- Check `opencode.json` for `"share": "disabled"`
- Remove or change to `"manual"` or `"auto"`
- Contact workspace admin if in enterprise

### Cannot Access Shared Link

**Problem**: Link shows 404 or error

**Solutions**:
- Verify the URL is complete and correct
- Check internet connectivity
- Try opening in incognito/private mode
- The share service may be temporarily down

### Import Failed

**Problem**: Cannot import shared session

**Solutions**:
- Verify the URL is valid
- Check internet connectivity
- Ensure you have disk space
- Try importing to a different directory

## Enterprise Considerations

For organizations:

### Disable Public Sharing

Completely disable sharing:

```json
{
  "share": "disabled"
}
```

### Self-Hosted Sharing

Set up internal sharing service:

```json
{
  "share": {
    "url": "https://opencode-share.internal.company.com",
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

### Audit Trail

Log all share events:

```json
{
  "audit": {
    "share": true
  }
}
```
