OpenCode can run as a web application in your browser, providing the same powerful AI coding experience without needing a terminal. The web interface offers a modern, graphical experience with file trees, diff viewers, and session management.

## Getting Started

Start the web interface by running:

```bash
opencode web
```

This starts a local server on `127.0.0.1` with a random available port and automatically opens OpenCode in your default browser.

<Note>
If `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` is not set, the server will be unsecured. This is fine for local use but should be set for network access.
</Note>

<Tip>
**Windows Users:** For the best experience, run `opencode web` from WSL rather than PowerShell. This ensures proper file system access and terminal integration.
</Tip>

---

## Configuration

You can configure the web server using command line flags or your OpenCode config file.

### Port

By default, OpenCode picks an available port. Specify a port:

```bash
opencode web --port 4096
```

### Hostname

By default, the server binds to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only). To make OpenCode accessible on your network:

```bash
opencode web --hostname 0.0.0.0
```

When using `0.0.0.0`, OpenCode displays both local and network addresses:

```
Local access:       http://localhost:4096
Network access:     http://192.168.1.100:4096
```

### mDNS Discovery

Enable mDNS to make your server discoverable on the local network:

```bash
opencode web --mdns
```

This automatically sets the hostname to `0.0.0.0` and advertises the server as `opencode.local`.

Customize the mDNS domain name to run multiple instances:

```bash
opencode web --mdns --mdns-domain myproject.local
```

### CORS

Allow additional domains for CORS (useful for custom frontends):

```bash
opencode web --cors https://example.com
```

### Authentication

Protect access with a password using environment variables:

```bash
OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD=secret opencode web
```

The username defaults to `opencode` but can be changed:

```bash
OPENCODE_SERVER_USERNAME=myuser OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD=secret opencode web
```

---

## Config File

Configure server settings in your `opencode.json` config file:

```json
{
  "server": {
    "port": 4096,
    "hostname": "0.0.0.0",
    "mdns": true,
    "cors": ["https://example.com"]
  }
}
```

Command line flags take precedence over config file settings.

## Using the Web Interface

Once started, the web interface provides a comprehensive view of your OpenCode sessions and workspace.

### Sessions

The homepage displays your sessions with key information:

- Active sessions with recent activity
- Session titles and timestamps
- Quick access to start new sessions

Click on a session to open it and continue your conversation.

### Chat Interface

The main chat interface includes:

- **Message Timeline** - View the full conversation history
- **Composer** - Write and submit messages to the AI
- **File References** - Add files to context using `@` mentions
- **Command Palette** - Access slash commands like `/compact`, `/share`, etc.
- **Model Selector** - Switch between available AI models
- **Agent Selector** - Choose different agent modes

### File Explorer

The file tree panel allows you to:

- Browse your project files
- Open files in the editor
- View file changes made during the session
- Add files to the conversation context

Toggle the file tree with the sidebar button or keyboard shortcut.

### Review Panel

The review panel shows all changes made during the session:

- **Session Changes** - All file modifications in the current session
- **Turn Changes** - Changes from the most recent AI response
- **Unified/Split Diff** - Toggle between diff viewing modes
- **Line Comments** - Add comments to specific code sections

The review panel helps you track and understand what the AI has modified.

### Terminal Panel

Access an integrated terminal for running commands:

- Run shell commands
- View command output
- Execute build scripts and tests
- Debug and explore your codebase

The terminal integrates seamlessly with the chat, allowing the AI to see command outputs.

### Context Management

Manage conversation context efficiently:

- **Context Tab** - View all files and information in the current context
- **Add/Remove Files** - Control what the AI can see
- **Context Usage** - Monitor token usage and context limits
- **Comments** - Add notes and instructions to specific code sections

### Server Status

Click "See Servers" on the homepage to view:

- Connected servers and their status
- Server URLs and connection information
- Health and availability indicators

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The web interface supports keyboard shortcuts for efficient navigation:

- `Cmd/Ctrl + K` - Open command palette
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` - Submit message
- `Cmd/Ctrl + N` - New session
- `Cmd/Ctrl + /` - Focus chat input
- `Cmd/Ctrl + B` - Toggle file tree
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R` - Toggle review panel

---

## Mobile Support

The web interface is fully responsive and works on mobile devices:

- Touch-optimized interface
- Mobile-friendly navigation
- Swipe gestures for panels
- Tab-based layout for session and changes

Access OpenCode from your phone or tablet when away from your desk.

---

## Attaching a Terminal TUI

You can attach a terminal TUI to a running web server:

```bash
# Start the web server
opencode web --port 4096

# In another terminal, attach the TUI
opencode attach http://localhost:4096
```

This allows you to use both the web interface and terminal simultaneously, sharing the same sessions and state.

<Tip>
Use the TUI for quick keyboard-driven tasks and the web interface for visual file browsing and diff review.
</Tip>

---

## Session Management

### Creating Sessions

Start a new session from the homepage or use the "New Session" button in the interface.

You can also create sessions with specific configurations:

- Choose a starting model
- Select an agent mode
- Set a working directory

### Sharing Sessions

Share sessions with team members:

1. Click the share button or use `/share` command
2. Copy the generated link
3. Share the link with others

Shared sessions are read-only by default. Recipients can view the conversation and fork it to continue working.

### Forking Sessions

Create a fork of an existing session to explore alternative approaches:

1. Open the session you want to fork
2. Click the fork button in the session header
3. Continue from that point with a new session ID

Forking is useful for trying different solutions without affecting the original conversation.

## Collaborative Features

### Multiple Windows

Open the same session in multiple browser windows or tabs. All instances stay synchronized:

- Messages appear in real-time across all windows
- File changes are reflected immediately
- Tool execution shows progress everywhere

### Cross-Device Access

With network access enabled, access your OpenCode server from any device on your network:

```bash
opencode web --hostname 0.0.0.0 --port 4096
```

Then open `http://<your-ip>:4096` on another device.

---

## Performance Optimization

### Session Compaction

As conversations grow, compact them to reduce context usage:

1. Use the `/compact` command
2. Or click "Compact" in the session menu

Compaction summarizes previous turns while preserving important context.

### Context Limits

Monitor context usage in the session header:

- Token usage indicator shows current usage vs. model limits
- Warning appears when approaching the limit
- Compact or start a new session when needed

---

## Advanced Features

### MCP Servers

The web interface supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers configured in your OpenCode settings. MCP servers provide additional tools and capabilities to the AI.

### Custom Commands

Custom slash commands defined in your OpenCode configuration are available in the web interface command palette.

### Themes

The web interface supports multiple themes:

- Light and dark modes
- Automatic theme switching based on system preferences
- Custom theme configurations

### Language Support

The interface includes internationalization support for multiple languages. Language settings follow your browser preferences.

## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start

If the server fails to start:

1. Check if the port is already in use
2. Try a different port: `opencode web --port 4097`
3. Check firewall settings for blocked ports

### Can't Access from Network

If other devices can't connect:

1. Ensure you're using `--hostname 0.0.0.0`
2. Check firewall rules allow the port
3. Verify network connectivity between devices

### Authentication Issues

If authentication isn't working:

1. Verify `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` is set
2. Check username if using custom `OPENCODE_SERVER_USERNAME`
3. Clear browser cookies and try again

### Performance Issues

If the interface feels slow:

1. Compact long sessions to reduce history
2. Close unused tabs and file previews
3. Check network latency if using remote access
4. Consider starting a new session for fresh performance
